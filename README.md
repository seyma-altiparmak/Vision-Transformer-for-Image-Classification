# Vision-Transformer-for-Image-Classification

## What is ViT?
- Vision Transformer (ViT) offers a flexible approach for working with large images by using the Transformer architecture instead of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. ViT brings the advantages of Transformers used in NLP to image processing tasks, enabling it to learn from a broader range of images with less data and showcasing strong transfer learning capabilities.

## OxfordIIITPet Dataset and Image Classification using Vision Transformer (ViT)
- This code example demonstrates image classification using the OxfordIIITPet dataset and the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. It showcases how to build and train a ViT model for image classification tasks.

### Content:
- **Loading and Visualizing the Dataset:** Firstly, the OxfordIIITPet dataset is downloaded and loaded. Then, sample images from the dataset are visualized.
- **Image Patching (Patch Embedding):** Images are converted into patch vectors that can be fed into the ViT model.
- **Attention Mechanism and Pre-Normalization (Pre-Norm):** The attention mechanism and pre-normalization layers in the ViT model are defined.
- **FeedForward Network (FeedForward) and Residual Connection (ResidualAdd):** The feedforward network and residual connection layers are used in the model.
- **Vision Transformer Model:** The above components are combined to construct the ViT model.
- **Training:** The model is trained for a certain number of epochs, and training loss along with test loss is observed.
- **Results:** The trained model is tested with examples from the test dataset, and predicted classes are compared with the ground truth classes.

### Conclusion
- Through a YouTube tutorial, I learned how to build and train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using PyTorch. Starting with dataset loading and visualization, I gained insights into image patching, attention mechanisms, and the Transformer architecture. Experimentation with hyperparameters and model architectures deepened my understanding. Witnessing the model's performance during training boosted my confidence. This tutorial provided practical skills and a solid foundation for future exploration in computer vision and machine learning.
